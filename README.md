This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

# Documentation

## Architecure Decision Records

This project uses [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to document architecture decisions.

To install `adr-tools` on macOS using Homebrew run:

```
brew install adr-tools
```

All architecture decision records are stored in the `./docs/architecture/decision` directory.

To create a new Architecture Decision Record run:

```
adr new Use React Native CLI
```

To create a new ADR that supercedes a previous one (ADR 9, for example), use the -s option.

```
 adr new -s 9 Remove Flipper
```

To generate or update the Table of Contents run:

```
adr generate toc > docs/architecture/decisions/index.md
```
